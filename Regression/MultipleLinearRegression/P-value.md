# P Value
P value is a statistical measure that helps scientists determine whether or not their hypotheses are correct.<br />
## Function
P values are used to determine whether the results of their experiment are within the normal range. 
Usually, if the P value of a data set is below a certain pre-determined amount (like, for instance, 0.05), 
scientists will reject the "null hypothesis" of their experiment.
In other words, they'll rule out the hypothesis that the variables of their experiment had no meaningful effect on the results.
